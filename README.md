# About Process Energy Estimation üí°

While computing currently represents roughly 0.5% of the world‚Äôs energy consumption, that percentage is projected to grow beyond 2% in the coming years, which will entail a significant rise in global CO2 emissions if not done properly. Given this increase, it is important to quantify and track the extent and origin of this energy usage, and to minimize the emissions incurred as much as possible.

The concept of green computing promotes the eficient use of  computational processing resources that are normally used without regard to the respective energy cost.

For this purpose, we created **Process Energy Estimation**, a Python package for tracking the energy consumed by computer programs, from straightforward algorithms to deep neural networks.

By taking into account your computing hardware, usage and running time, Process Energy Estimation can provide an estimate of how much energy you consumed.

Follow the steps below to set up the package and don't hesitate to open an issue if you need help!

# Installation :battery:
Clone or download the repository present in [this github page](https://github.com/rafaeldpsilva/process-energy-monitor)

### Using git

```
git clone https://github.com/rafaeldpsilva/process-energy-monitor.git
````
Then extract the folder [`process-energy-estimation/`](/process-energy-estimation/)  to the root of your project

## Intel Power Gadget

To install Intel Power Gadget, follow the instructions given on [this website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/power-gadget.html)

After the successful install, add the path of the folder where the tool is installed to the `$PATH` environment variable.

Check if it is installed correctly by running the following command in the terminal:
```
PowerLog3.0.exe -h
````

## Nvidia System Management Interface

The nvidia-smi utility normally gets installed in the driver install step. It cannot/does not get installed in any other installation step.

If you install a NVIDIA GPU driver using a repository that is maintained by NVIDIA, you will always get the nvidia-smi utility with any recent driver install.

You can check if it is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:
```
nvidia-smi -h
````
## Install Dependencies

In order to run the code successfully you also need to install some dependencies. Run this three commands to do so:

```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install psutil
````


`process-energy-estimation` is now installed in your the local environment

# Quickstart üöÄ

### Configuration
This software needs to be configured through a file in a json format, similar to this:

```json
{
    "BASE_CHECK_SECONDS":5,
    "REPORTS_PATH": "./process-energy-estimation/reports/",
    "POWERLOG_FILENAME" : "powerlog.csv",
    "PROCESS_FILENAME" : "process.csv",
    "NVIDIA_SMI_FILENAME" : "nvidia.csv",
    "TOTAL_PROCESS_DATA" : "total_process_data.csv",
    "COMMAND" : "python sorting_algorithms.py", 
    "INTERVAL" : 100,
    "PHYSICAL_CPU_SOCKETS": 1,
    "CPU": 1,
    "GPU": 1,
    "DRAM": 1,
    "CPU_USAGE_COLLECTOR": 1,
    "SOC_GPU": 1
}
```

Process Energy Estimation will look sequentially for arguments in:

- `BASE_CHECK_SECONDS`: duration of base consumption reading
- `REPORTS_PATH`: path to the folder in which reports will be saved
- `POWERLOG_FILENAME`: name of the file in which the data from Inter Power Gadget will be saved
- `PROCESS_FILENAME`: name of the file in which the process cpu usage data will be saved
- `NVIDIA_SMI_FILENAME`: name of the file in which the data from Nvidia System Management Interface will be saved
- `TOTAL_PROCESS_DATA`: name of the file in which the data created by the two tools and the system will be saved
- `COMMAND`: the command line to run the software you pretend to measure
- `INTERVAL`: miliseconds interval to read the GPU information
- `PHYSICAL_CPU_SOCKETS`: number of physical cpu sockets present in the system
- `CPU`: 1 or 0 if the component energy consumption is taken in consideration or not, respectively
- `GPU`: 1 or 0 if the component energy consumption is taken in consideration or not, respectively
- `DRAM`: 1 or 0 if the component energy consumption is taken in consideration or not, respectively
- `CPU_USAGE_COLLECTOR`: way of reading the total cpu usage (1-Intel Power Gadget, 2-psutil library)
- `SOC_GPU`: 1 or 0 if SOC has an integrated GPU or not, respectively

# Examples üê§
As an illustration of how to use Process Energy Estimation, we created a simple example using the sorting algorithm [Stooge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stooge-sort/):

In the [`examples/`](/examples/) folder run:

```
python ./process-energy-estimation/main.py
```
Which should output something like the following lines, one for base consumption and the other for the process consumption:

```
ProcessReport 
Max Temp = 100
number of nodes = 1
TDP(mWh)_0 = 15.00
Base Frequency = 2001.00(MHz)
Logging...Done


Process Consumption

-------------------------CPU-------------------------
Number of CPU Sockets: 1

Average CPU 0 Power: 17.7172 Watts
CPU 0 Energy Consumption: 0.0641 Wh

-------------------------GPU-------------------------
Number of GPU Units: 1

Average GPU 0 Power: 5.6009 Watts
GPU 0 Energy Consumption: 0.0203 Wh

-------------------------DRAM------------------------
Average DRAM Power: 0.7053 Watts
DRAM Energy Consumption: 0.0025 Wh

-------------------------TOTAL-----------------------
The process lasted: 13.027 Seconds
The process consumed: 24.0234 Watts
The process consumed: 0.0869 Wh
```
This will also create several `.csv` files in the [`reports/`](/examples/reports/) folder with information created by this [`system`](/examples/process-energy-estimation/reports/total_process_data.csv), [`Intel Power Gadget`](/examples/process-energy-estimation/reports/powerlog.csv) and [`Nvidia System Management Interface`](/examples/process-energy-estimation/reports/powerlog.csv). There are also auxiliary files such as [`process.csv`](/examples/process-energy-estimation/reports/process.csv), which has the cpu utilization percentage, and the [`gpu.csv`](/examples/process-energy-estimation/reports/gpu.csv), which shows the energy consumption of the gpu(s), in the respective column(s).

# Infrastructure Support üñ•Ô∏è
Currently the package supports following hardware infrastructure.

### GPU
- Tracks Nvidia GPUs power consumption using `nvidia-smi` command.

### CPU

#### Windows
- Tracks Intel processors power consumption using the `Intel Power Gadget`
- You need to **[install it independently](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html)** for Process Energy Consumption to function.
